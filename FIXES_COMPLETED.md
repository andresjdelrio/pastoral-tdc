# Audience Selection Bug Fixes - COMPLETED

## Date: 2025-09-17

## Problem Summary
The user reported that audience selection during CSV upload wasn't working - regardless of selecting "colaborador" vs "estudiante", all registrants showed as "estudiante" in the system. This was critical because the audience field is used for filtering, indicators, attendance, etc.

## Root Cause
The system was correctly saving audience during upload, but all API endpoints (indicators, activities, database) were recalculating audience from career patterns instead of using the saved field. This violated the user's principle: "what is written during upload must be the thing that is on the data, nothing else, not case when or any of that."

## Files Fixed

### 1. indicators.py (✅ COMPLETED)
**Location**: `backend/app/routers/indicators.py`
**Fix**: Changed SQL from complex CASE statements to `COALESCE(r.audience, 'estudiantes')`
**Lines**: 82-96, base query WITH clause
```sql
WITH audience_data AS (
    SELECT
        a.year,
        a.strategic_line,
        reg.id as registration_id,
        r.id as registrant_id,
        r.full_name,
        reg.attended,
        COALESCE(r.audience, 'estudiantes') as audience
    FROM registrations reg
    JOIN activities a ON reg.activity_id = a.id
    JOIN registrants r ON reg.registrant_id = r.id
)
```

### 2. activities.py (✅ COMPLETED)
**Location**: `backend/app/routers/activities.py`
**Changes**:
1. Added audience field to query (line 188): `Registrant.audience`
2. Fixed person_type calculation (line 221): Uses saved audience field
3. Fixed filtering (lines 207-208): Replaced 70+ lines of career-based logic
```python
# FIXED: Apply audience filter using saved audience field - respect user's explicit selection
if audience:
    query = query.filter(Registrant.audience == audience)
```
4. Response formatting (line 221): `person_type = 'student' if result.audience == 'estudiantes' else 'collaborator'`

### 3. database.py (✅ COMPLETED)
**Location**: `backend/app/routers/database.py`
**Changes**:
1. Added audience field to query (line 116): `Registrant.audience`
2. Fixed classification (line 157): `audience_classification = result.audience or 'estudiantes'`
3. Fixed filtering (lines 142-143): `query = query.filter(Registrant.audience == audience)`

## Testing Results

### Upload Functionality ✅
- CSV upload correctly saves "colaboradores" to database
- Debug logs confirm: `[FINAL DEBUG] Setting registrant X audience to: colaboradores`

### Indicators API ✅
- Shows correct 19 colaboradores, 1 estudiante
- No longer recalculates from career patterns

### Activities/Attendance API ✅
- Activity 10: 21 colaboradores filter works correctly
- Activity 9: 172 estudiantes filter works correctly
- Year filter: Only 2025 activities shown
- Combined filters work properly

### Database API ✅
- `audience=colaboradores`: 21 results
- `audience=estudiantes`: 173 results
- `year=2025`: 194 results (173 + 21)
- Combined filters: 21 colaboradores from 2025

## Key Principle Enforced
**User's Requirement**: "when uploading data, i complete fields 'linea estrategica','actividad','año' and 'audincia', DO NOT apply rules to determine those fields, what is written is the thing that must be on th data, nothing else, not case when or any of that"

**Solution**: All endpoints now use the explicitly saved `audience` field instead of recalculating from career patterns.

## Current State
- ✅ Upload process saves audience correctly
- ✅ Indicators API uses saved audience field
- ✅ Activities API uses saved audience field and filters work
- ✅ Database API uses saved audience field and filters work
- ✅ All filtering functionality responds to user selections
- ✅ No more career-based classification overrides
